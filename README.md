# Custom Scripts for TextBuddy.app

[TextBuddy]: https://textbuddy.app/

This repository collects my (Brett Terpstra) custom scripts for [TextBuddy][], a Mac app by Tyler Hall.

To use the scripts, open TextBuddy and choose __Scripts->Open Scripts Folder__ from the menu. Save any script from this repository to that folder (ensuring that the extension is `.js`).

Once a script is located in that folder, it can be run in TextBuddy using `âŒ˜R`.
